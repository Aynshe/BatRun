# BatRun
Launcher for RetroBat with Hotkey gamepad select/back+start xinput or dinput  /  -publish self contained-

1.1 : Add mapping automatic also in Dinput - "source : gamecontrollerdb in RetroBat" "But the BatRun plugin startup is slower..."

Having no other Dinput Joystick than my old "SideWinder Game Pad Pro USB version 1.0", I am not able to test.
Also, I do not know if it is my old Dinput controller, I sometimes need to insist a little on the hotkey command.

*the code is certainly not very clean... .!
