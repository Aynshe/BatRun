# BatRun
Launcher for RetroBat with Hotkey gamepad select/back+start xinput or dinput  /  -publish self contained-
Mapping automatic also in Dinput - "source : gamecontrollerdb in RetroBat" "But the BatRun plugin startup is slower..." (start with a wait splash)


Having no other Dinput Joystick than my old "SideWinder Game Pad Pro USB version 1.0", I am not able to test.
I do not know if it is my old Dinput controller, I sometimes need to insist a little on the hotkey.
*the code is certainly not very clean... .!
